JTemplate plugin
================

This plugin helps you to fill variables in a template file. It was originally designed to fill custom tags in HTML file. However, it can be used in any context since it does not depend on HTML handling routines.
In other words, if you have a model of a letter and wold like to fill sender and address; if ou have a report and would replace a tag by a query in database; in short, if you desire to fill variables in a file marked with tags, JTemplate is the ideal feature for you.
